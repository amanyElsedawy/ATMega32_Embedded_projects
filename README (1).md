# ATMega32_Embedded_Projects

This repository contains a collection of embedded systems projects developed using the ATmega32 microcontroller.  
Each project covers a specific concept, peripheral, or communication protocol used in embedded system applications.

 📁 Project Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a separate project with its own source code and belongings.

### Examples include:
- ✅ LCD interfaces and custom characters
- ✅ Keypad-controlled applications
- ✅ DC, Servo, and Stepper motor control
- ✅ ADC applications (e.g., LM35, LDR)
- ✅ Timers (PWM, CTC, overflow)
- ✅ UART / SPI communication
- ✅ Login systems, countdown timers, interactive menus
 📌 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal learning archive and showcases the development of embedded applications using direct register-level programming and modular driver layers.

 🔧 Each project folder contains:
- main.c: The main application code
- MCAL/: Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (e.g., DIO, ADC, UART, SPI)
- HAL/: High-level abstraction layer (e.g., LCD, keypad, motor drivers)
